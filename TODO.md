# TODO
+ repeated sequential prompting
+ 8bit issue with temperature sampling
+ change evals to multiplications
- readme with the new cli
- fabricmanager handled
- import base in sample model





## Leg
- Additions benchmark; few shot prompt with additions from 1 to 300
  - measure bench results on all models + ssp models
- More "releasable" version (same)
  - clean readme recipe to reproduce everything
- (opt) Use meta code to do the same

## Readme
- make the ideal readme structure
- correct the timings for Ssp improvements
- explain 65B does not perform well
- caveats


- Experiments to get a good speedup on p4

## Working code for video

## Video
- make the vid script and describe the view

## 
- Cleaner logs
  - Clear completions & timings for each example
  - use logging for debugging output
  - change command line to get output & errors on files too
- Run timings on all models on A100 machine, get all the speeds
- Run SSP timings for various model configurations

- Try sampling with temperature 1 & observing on additions
- Capture in readme all the stuff
